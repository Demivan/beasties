> beasties-webpack-plugin inlines your app's [critical CSS] and lazy-loads the rest.

## beasties-webpack-plugin [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beasties-webpack-plugin.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/beasties-webpack-plugin)

It's a little different from [other options](#similar-libraries), because it **doesn't use a headless browser** to render content. This tradeoff allows Beasties to be very **fast and lightweight**. It also means Beasties inlines all CSS rules used by your document, rather than only those needed for above-the-fold content. For alternatives, see [Similar Libraries](#similar-libraries).

Beasties' design makes it a good fit when inlining critical CSS for prerendered/SSR'd Single Page Applications. It was developed to be an excellent compliment to [prerender-loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/prerender-loader), combining to dramatically improve first paint time for most Single Page Applications.

## Features

*   Fast - no browser, few dependencies
*   Integrates with [html-webpack-plugin]
*   Works with `webpack-dev-server` / `webpack serve`
*   Supports preloading and/or inlining critical fonts
*   Prunes unused CSS keyframes and media queries
*   Removes inlined CSS rules from lazy-loaded stylesheets

## Installation

First, install Beasties as a development dependency:

```sh
npm i -D beasties-webpack-plugin
```

Then, import Beasties into your Webpack configuration and add it to your list of plugins:

```diff
// webpack.config.js
+const Beasties = require('beasties-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
+    new Beasties({
+      // optional configuration (see below)
+    })
  ]
}
```

That's it! Now when you run Webpack, the CSS used by your HTML will be inlined and the imports for your full CSS will be converted to load asynchronously.
